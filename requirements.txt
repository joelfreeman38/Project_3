# Notes:

# GPU-enabled setup: ensure torch is installed with CUDA support (e.g., torch==1.13.1+cu117).

# CPU-only setup: standard torch version suffices.

# Windows users: pydub requires ffmpeg installed and added to PATH.

# Datasets:

# At least one dataset must be set to "True" to run the notebook (ds1 is the smallest):

DATASETS = {
    "ds1": (True,  "./data/ds1_transformed_mental_health_chatbot_dataset.csv",  "question", "answer"),

# Model training:

# Models are never overwritten. They are built/enhanced with every training run.

# Comment out the following for each model to disable training:
trainer.train().
