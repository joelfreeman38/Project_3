# Project: 3 - Mental Health Chat Bot
Final Project for AI/ML Data Science Bootcamp - April 2025

Project Proposal: Team 3 proposes creating a Mental Health chat bot that can help users/patients understand the symptoms they are experiencing, provide relevant information, and direct them additional resources. In essense, this will be a recommendation system that helps those suffering from mental health issues receive the most correct and timely care possible.

To help tailor the best steps for building our mental health chatbot, we need to determine the following:
- Who is our target audience? (e.g., teens, adults, veterans, general population)
- Are we planning for this to be text-only, or will it include voice or visual elements?
- What platform(s) do we envision this chatbot running on? (e.g., mobile app, website, messaging platforms)
- Support multiple languages?
- Integration with external mental health resources (e.g., hotlines, therapy databases, healthcare providers)?
