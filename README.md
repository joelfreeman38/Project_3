# Project: 3 - Mental Health Chat Bot
Final Project for AI/ML Data Science Bootcamp - April 2025

Project Proposal: Team 3 proposes creating a Mental Health chat bot that can help users/patients understand the symptoms they are experiencing, provide relevant information, and direct them additional resources. In essense, this will be a recommendation system that helps those suffering from mental health issues receive the most correct and timely care possible.

The primary goal of the mental health chatbot is to offer real-time, accessible, and anonymous support to individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, depression, or other mental health challenges. The chatbot's capabilities can range from simple mood tracking to more advanced features like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) exercises, emotional validation, or connecting users with mental health professionals.

# Development Roadmap for a Cross-Platform Mental Health Chatbot

# Goals

- Inclusive Audience: Designed for all demographics.

- Multimodal Interaction: Supports voice and text input.

- Cross-Platform: Available on iPhones and PCs.

- Multilingual Support: Includes major global languages.

- Resource Integration: Connects users with hotlines, therapy directories, and clinical support.

- Development Phases

# Phase 1: Research and Planning

- Define user personas and mental health needs.

- Study existing chatbots (e.g., Woebot, Wysa) to understand best practices.

- Consult with licensed mental health professionals.

- Draft core features and Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

- Address ethical considerations: privacy, safety, inclusivity.

# Phase 2: UX and Conversation Design

- Design user interface for iOS and web/desktop.

- Create onboarding flow and accessibility options.

- Define chatbot personality: empathetic and non-judgmental.

- Draft conversation scripts and flows for common issues.

- Plan multilingual content with cultural nuance.

# Phase 3: Technical Architecture

- Choose development stack:

- Frontend: Swift (iOS), React/Web.

- Backend: Node.js or Python (FastAPI), Rasa/Dialogflow.

- Database: PostgreSQL or Firebase.

- Define backend architecture: NLP engine, resource APIs, data storage.

- Prepare for scalability and secure data handling.

# Phase 4: MVP Development

- Implement text-based chatbot with core conversations.

- Enable basic mood check-ins and responses.

- Integrate with key external resources (hotlines, therapy links).

- Include sentiment analysis and fallback responses.

- Allow anonymous access and minimal data retention.

# Phase 5: Voice Interaction

- Add Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS):

- iOS: Apple Speech API.

- Web: Web Speech API.

- Ensure accurate language detection and feedback.

- Include visual/audio feedback for accessibility.

# Phase 6: Multilingual Support

- Translate all chatbot content.

- Use multilingual NLP models (e.g., multilingual BERT).

- Allow user to set preferred language or detect automatically.

- Localize UI and external resources per region.

# Phase 7: Resource Integration

- Embed hotline information based on user location.

- Connect to therapy directories or scheduling platforms.

- Suggest local, low-cost, or specialized support.

- Use APIs or curated databases for resource links.

# Phase 8: Enhancements and Features

- Personalization: Save user preferences and context.

- Mood Tracking: Visual mood journals, trends over time.

- Exercises: Guided CBT, breathing, mindfulness prompts.

- Journaling: Let users reflect and save entries securely.

- User Analytics: (Opt-in) Provide insights or progress summaries.

- Privacy: Full anonymity, optional accounts, data deletion tools.

# Phase 9: Testing and Deployment

- Conduct unit, integration, and UX testing.

- Evaluate ethical safeguards (bias, privacy, emergency handling).

- Run closed beta with user feedback collection.

- Launch on App Store and public web URL.

- Monitor usage and feedback for iterative improvements.
