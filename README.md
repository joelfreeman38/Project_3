## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This repository contains the complete development of a Mental Health Chatbot. The chatbot provides real-time, accessible, and private support to individuals facing mental health challenges. It serves as a tool for emotional validation, self-help resources, and guidance toward professional care.
This notebook implements a robust, emotion-aware chatbot system that combines emotional classification with response generation using a RoBERTa + T5 hybrid architecture. The system is trained on multiple datasets, supports real-time chat via Gradio, and saves all models and metadata for reproducibility.

---

## ðŸ”§ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Mental-Health-Chatbot.git
cd Mental-Health-Chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

To run the chatbot locally:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This launches the web app with a chat interface that supports emotional understanding.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Data

Trained on mental health Q&A datasets from Kaggle and Hugging Face, preprocessed and labeled with multi-label binarization and tokenized with Hugging Face tokenizers.

---

## ðŸ¤– Model Development

### Initial Model
- DistilBERT baseline
- Limitations in multi-emotion understanding

### Enhanced Model
- RoBERTa (emotion classification)
- Two T5 models (Chat-style & QA-style responses)
- BCEWithLogitsLoss + custom routing logic

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation

- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visual and sample-based assessment
- Reduced hallucinations

---

## ðŸ§ª Results

- 10â€“15% improvement in multi-label accuracy
- Reliable tone detection and emotional coherence
- Lightweight deployment with Streamlit

---

## ðŸ“˜ Full Technical Summary

This system combines emotional classification with response generation using a RoBERTa + T5 hybrid. It loads and preprocesses mental health datasets, performs multi-label binarization for emotional tagging, and routes user queries based on emotional detection.

### Highlights:
- Modular: separate RoBERTa + 2x T5s
- Routed inference logic based on emotion scores
- Saves all models/tokenizers with `.pt` metadata
- Integrated with a Gradio UI for real-time chat

Refer to [summary.txt](summary.txt) for the full breakdown.
